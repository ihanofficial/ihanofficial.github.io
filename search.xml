        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Original Title: Four habits to stay focused in a world full of distractions</strong></p><p>Many of us believe we’re adept at juggling interruptions, but research tells a different story, according to Gloria Mark, Chancellor’s Professor of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, and the author of Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness, and Productivity.</p><p>“Think of your mind as a whiteboard,” she says. </p><p>“Each task or topic you focus on is like writing on that whiteboard. When you multitask, you’re constantly erasing and rewriting different information.”</p><p>All that switching comes at a cost. </p><p>Studies show that multitasking leads to longer completion times, more errors, and increased stress. </p><p>“Your executive function — your brain’s CEO — gets fatigued,” says Mark. </p><p>“And it struggles to filter out distractions or make decisions, leaving you even more susceptible to interruptions.”</p><p>So how can you strengthen your focus skills and stay on track? </p><p>What simple techniques can help you cut down on interruptions? </p><p>And how can you create an environment that supports better concentration? Here’s what experts suggest.</p><h1 id="Lay-the-groundwork"><a href="#Lay-the-groundwork" class="headerlink" title="Lay the groundwork."></a>Lay the groundwork.</h1><p>Optimizing your brain for focus starts with fundamental self-care, according to Montminy. </p><p>“You need to prioritize foundational habits like sleep, hydration, and physical activity,” she says. </p><p>“You could try all the mental health hacks in the world, and you’re not going to get anywhere if you’re not sleeping well and not hydrating.”</p><p>Creating consistent environmental cues is also key. </p><p>Montminy recommends establishing “focus rituals,” or signals that tell your brain it’s time to concentrate — like a dedicated workspace, a particular desk setup, or a consistent routine that primes you for deep work. </p><p>Mark suggests practical steps to eliminate distractions: turn off notifications, lock away your phone when working, and use app blockers to hide digital temptations. </p><p>The goal is to “create friction” and make it harder to be distracted, she says.</p><h1 id="Train-your-brain’s-attention"><a href="#Train-your-brain’s-attention" class="headerlink" title="Train your brain’s attention."></a>Train your brain’s attention.</h1><p>With the fundamentals in place, you next need to harness your natural focus. </p><p>Our attention is goal-directed, meaning we naturally concentrate on what aligns with our objectives and priorities, explains Mark.</p><p>This principle is rooted in the work of William James, widely considered the father of American psychology.</p><p>“If your goals are very clear, that’s going to keep you focused.” </p><p>To tap into this attentional bias and selectively focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others, Mark recommends a concrete approach: “Write down your goals and put them in a place where they’re in your visual field,” she says. </p><p>“Put them on a post-it if that’s what it takes for you to be constantly reminded of what you’re trying to accomplish.” </p><p>Surrounding yourself with visual reminders of your goals helps train your brain to zero in on what’s essential.</p><h1 id="Direct-your-emotions"><a href="#Direct-your-emotions" class="headerlink" title="Direct your emotions."></a>Direct your emotions.</h1><p>Goal setting isn’t just about accomplishing tasks; it’s also a powerful strategy for regulating and managing emotions. </p><p>“People who feel more positive can actually focus better, do more, and be more creative,” says Mark. </p><p>She recommends envisioning your desired emotional state to guide behavior. So, ask yourself: “At 7 PM, how do I want to feel?” </p><p>You might, for instance, picture yourself peaceful and relaxed, enjoying a quiet moment on the couch with a book, or happily unwinding with friends. </p><p>By setting emotional goals, you’re creating a neurobiological roadmap that helps your brain seek balance and reduce stress. </p><p>“Picture the end result,” Montminy advises. </p><p>“Visualize what it looks like, sit in the feeling of it, and imagine the relief.” </p><p>The aim is to preemptively savor a sense of accomplishment, which can sharpen your focus.</p><h1 id="Tune-into-your-energy-patterns"><a href="#Tune-into-your-energy-patterns" class="headerlink" title="Tune into your energy patterns."></a>Tune into your energy patterns.</h1><p>Your attention at work has a rhythm, says Mark. </p><p>Your peak focus times are affected by your chronotype, or your natural circadian rhythm. </p><p>Mark’s research finds that most people have peak focus times around 11 AM and mid-afternoon, though this varies depending on whether you’re an early bird or night owl. </p><p>To discover your personal rhythm, keep a diary tracking your energy and concentration levels throughout the day. </p><p>“The desire to scroll or check your socials is a sign of your focus starting to quiver, usually toward the end of one of your cycles,” says Montminy. </p><p>Then, schedule demanding tasks during your peak cognitive hours and reserve less-complex work, like email, for when your energy dips. </p><p>“Understanding and adapting to your energy fluctuations helps you align your work schedule with your personal rhythm,” she says.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Original Title: Dining Alone is So Difficult</strong></p><p>There are few customers Conor Proft appreciates more than people who eat alone.</p><p>A bartender at the Italian restaurant Fausto, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, he said the solo diners he serves tend to be more engaged and willing to chat.</p><p>They are self-aware and more attuned to the restaurant’s rhythms.</p><p>But does Mr. Proft dine alone? Rarely.</p><p>“I love the romantic ideal of going into a restaurant and sitting at the bar and striking up a conversation with a bartender,” he said.</p><p>“But oftentimes in practice, I am just consumed with anxiety” about standing out.</p><p>This is part of the paradox of solo dining.</p><p>Even as Americans are spending more time on their own, many find eating out alone to be rife with awkwardness and judgment.</p><p>And many restaurateurs, who already run their businesses on thin profit margins, worry that tables for one will cost them.</p><p>Reservations for solo dining in the United States have risen by 64 percent since 2019, according to data from OpenTable, and 21 percent from 2022 to 2023, according to Resy.</p><p>The trend may stem in part from a post-pandemic uptick in business trips, when solo travelers need to grab a bite, or the rising attention given to self-care, said Debby Soo, OpenTable’s chief executive.</p><p>But more solo dining doesn’t necessarily mean better accommodation or less of a stigma, according to diners and restaurateurs interviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>Several diners described the experience of entering a restaurant hoping to treat themselves to a relaxing meal, then feeling guilty for taking up space, or fearful that they’re being judged by everyone around them.</p><p>“When you walk in by yourself, the look on the host or hostess’s face changes,” said Rajika Shah, a lawyer in Los Angeles who used to dine alone frequently, as she moved often for work and wanted to explore local dining.</p><p>“It is sometimes a look of panic, like ‘What are we going to do with this person?’ Or sometimes it is a look of sympathy.”</p><p>Ms. Shah, 51, said she is often led to the worst table in the dining room, neglected by her server, and then rushed out at the end of the meal.</p><p>She blamed the tipping system — because workers are reliant on tips, she said, they may be less attentive to those who spend less than groups.</p><p>“I am just so tired of being treated like a second-class citizen,” she said.</p><p>Even the menu can feel exclusionary.</p><p>The shareable small plates that dominate many menus make it expensive and “difficult to eat a balanced and well-proportioned meal alone,” said Amanda Lao, 55, who lives in Chicago and started solo dining while traveling for her former job as an auditor.</p><p>The assumption that people need to be coupled or grouped goes beyond restaurants, said Bella DePaulo, a social psychologist in Summerland, Calif., and the author of the 2023 book “Single at Heart: The Power, Freedom and Heart-Filling Joy of Single Life.”</p><p>Scientists have long examined the negative impacts of solitude, but studies on how it can be a peaceful, self-esteem-building experience are rarer, she said.</p><p>The 2025 World Happiness Report, published last week by the University of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research Centre, suggests that solitary activities, including solo meals, can lead to depression and shorter life expectancies.</p><p>Dr. DePaulo also pointed to a recent, highly circulated article in The Atlantic, “The Anti-Social Century,” which links practices like solo dining to reclusion and loneliness.</p><p>Dr. DePaulo finds that conclusion dubious.</p><p>“People who are lonely are going to stay home,” she said. “They are not going to go out to a restaurant. People who go out on their own are confident.”</p><p>To her, this bias against lone diners feels distinctly American.</p><p>Since the 1950s, she said, the United States has placed a high value on the nuclear family.</p><p>“We are a nation that really romanticizes romantic coupling and marriage, and stigmatizing people who are single or do things alone is part of that,” she said.</p><p>She compared this with attitudes in countries like Japan, where it is common to see someone slurping ramen or enjoying an omakase solo.</p><p>At a time when 46.4 percent of American adults are single, according to 2022 census data, and many couples are sleeping or even living separately, Dr. DePaulo said, why shouldn’t it be socially acceptable to dine alone?</p><p>Several people interviewed said they felt more comfortable eating alone at a casual restaurant than at a high-end one.</p><p>Others said it felt easier in big cities, which allow you to be more anonymous when you walk into a restaurant.</p><p>Identity markers like race and gender also play a role.</p><p>Aaron Fountain, 33, an editor at the National Museum of African American History and Culture who lives in Silver Spring, Md., said he often gets poor treatment when he dines alone, whether it’s being asked to pay in advance at a sit-down restaurant or being ignored by bartenders.</p><p>He wondered if this is because he is Black, not because he is by himself.</p><p>Paula Shepard, a fashion executive in Manhattan, said that as a woman eating alone, she has drawn unwanted attention from men, and some have mistaken her for an escort.</p><p>But she is undeterred.</p><p>She knows that others may see her seated by herself and make assumptions.</p><p>“But I can’t allow others to define who I am,” she said. “I dined alone on Valentine’s Day, for God’s sake.”</p>]]></content>
