        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>People Using Artificial Intelligence At Work Are Happier, Healthier</strong></p><p>Today’s headlines are riddled with warnings about AI stealing jobs and making workers miserable. </p><p>But international researchers who actually followed real people for 20 years found the opposite. </p><p>Workers in AI - heavy jobs reported better health, unchanged job satisfaction, and no increase in anxiety about their futures. </p><p>The robots, it turns out, might be helping more than hurting.</p><p>Research published in <em>Scientific Reports</em> tracked nearly 18,500 workers from 2000 to 2020, comparing those in AI - heavy jobs with workers in traditional roles. </p><p>People working alongside AI reported better physical health and greater satisfaction with their well - being, while showing no increase in anxiety, depression, or job insecurity.</p><p>Americans are increasingly worried about AI’s impact on their livelihoods, from ChatGPT writing emails to robots manning factory floors. </p><p>This research suggests our fears might be overblown. </p><p>Instead of replacing human workers or making them miserable, AI appears to be making physically demanding jobs easier and potentially safer.</p><p>For example, instead of a warehouse worker lifting heavy boxes all day, AI - powered machinery handles the heavy lifting while the human focuses on oversight and decision - making. Rather than a nurse spending hours on paperwork, AI tools streamline administrative tasks, leaving more time for patient care.</p><p>The study followed workers through Germany’s gradual adoption of AI technology, which accelerated significantly after 2010. Researchers used an objective analysis that identified which jobs were most susceptible to AI automation, and self - reported data from workers about their actual use of AI technologies.</p><p>Unlike smaller studies that capture just a moment in time, this analysis tracked the same people over two decades, watching how their health and job satisfaction changed as AI became more common in their workplaces. </p><p>Researchers controlled for factors that could skew results, including age, education, industry, and regional differences.</p><p>Workers reported their life satisfaction, job satisfaction, and various health metrics on standardized scales. </p><p>Researchers also tracked concerns about job security and personal economic situations. </p><p>Results consistently showed either neutral or positive effects across nearly all measures. </p><p>Workers in AI - exposed occupations reported better overall health status and greater satisfaction with their health. </p><p>Researchers believe this stems from AI’s ability to reduce physically demanding and hazardous tasks — the kind of repetitive, back - breaking work that damages bodies over time.</p><p>Additionally, workers in AI - heavy jobs saw a modest reduction in working hours, about 30 minutes per week on average, without any negative impact on wages or employment rates. </p><p>This suggests AI might be creating more humane working conditions rather than eliminating jobs entirely. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Earth is predicted to increase its rotation speed in July and August, once again bucking the trend of a slower rotation over time.  </p><p>Though there are clear reasons for the increased rotational speed this summer, the cause of the recent increase in speed is a little puzzling to scientists.  </p><p>The Earth’s rotation has altered significantly over time.  </p><p>Right now, the Earth rotates just over 365 times on its axis in the time it takes to orbit around the Sun – this is our number of days in a year. </p><p>However, the length of the day has varied in Earth’s history, according to various calculations, meaning the number of days it took Earth to go around the Sun in the past has ranged from around 490 to 372 days.  </p><p>There are all sorts of factors that affect the speed of rotation, such as changing sea levels and shifts within the Earth, though the biggest factor is that the Moon is moving away from the Earth (who can blame it) and as the two bodies interact, the result is the Earth slowing down at a rate of about 1.8 milliseconds per century.  </p><p>In recent years, we have kept a precise track of the Earth’s day length using atomic clocks.</p><p>Normally, a leap second may be introduced every now and then to account for the slowing of the Earth.  </p><p>This is vital, for instance, to keep GPS operational.  </p><p>However, since 2020, the reverse has been true: the Earth’s rotation has been speeding up again.  </p><p>In 2020, the 28 shortest days since 1960 were recorded.  </p><p>Every year after that, the record for the shortest day has been broken, with the shortest day on record so far – set in 2024 – being 1.66 milliseconds short of the usual 86,400-second days.  </p><p>This year in July and August, we are predicted to have some shorter days again.  </p><p>Timeanddate.com reports that on July 9, the day is predicted to be 1.30 milliseconds shorter, based on observations and models from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and the United States Naval Observatory.  </p><p>July 22 is predicted to be 1.38 milliseconds shorter, while August 5 is predicted to be 1.5 milliseconds shorter than a usual day.  </p><p>While the Moon is thought to be responsible for the long-term slowing of the Earth’s rotation, it can also be a cause of acceleration.  </p><p>The closer to the Earth’s equator the Moon is, the more drag it has on the Earth.  </p><p>These days are predicted to be the shortest days of the year as the Moon is at its maximum distance away from the Earth’s equator.  </p><p>These shorter days are predictable by astronomers, but the trend is a little unexpected.  </p><p>Since 1972, there have been 27 leap seconds added to account for the decreased rotation rate of the Earth.  </p><p>But since 2016, not one leap second has been necessary, and the IERS has confirmed no leap second will be added this year in June.  </p><p>Nobody is entirely sure why the Earth’s trend of slower rotation appears to have reversed in recent years.  </p><p>“This lack of the need for leap seconds was not predicted,” Judah Levine, a physicist in the time and frequency division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, told <em>Discover Magazine</em> in 2021.  </p><p>“The assumption was, in fact, that Earth would continue to slow down and leap seconds would continue to be needed.  </p><p>And so this effect, this result, is very surprising.”  </p><p>“Nobody expected this,” Leonid Zotov, expert on Earth rotation at Moscow State University, told <em>Timeanddate.com</em>.  </p><p>“The cause of this acceleration is not explained.”  </p><p>“Most scientists believe it is something inside the Earth,” he added.  </p><p>“Ocean and atmospheric models don’t explain this huge acceleration.”  </p><p>Other factors that can affect the Earth’s rotation include earthquakes.  </p><p>“Earthquakes can change the Earth’s rotation by rearranging the Earth’s mass.  </p><p>This is what a spinning ice skater does to make herself spin faster.  </p><p>She moves her arms closer to her body, she’s moving her mass closer to the axis about which she’s rotating,” Dr Richard Gross of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory explained to <em>Popular Mechanics</em> in 2011.  </p><p>“And earthquakes do the same thing.”  </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Drinks including water, soda, beer and wine sold in glass bottles contain more microplastics than those in plastic bottles, according to a surprising study released by France’s food safety agency Friday. </p><p>Researchers have detected the tiny, mostly invisible pieces of plastic throughout the world, from in the air we breathe to the food we eat, as well as riddled throughout human bodies. </p><p>There is still no direct evidence that this preponderance of plastic is harmful to human health, but a burgeoning field of research is aiming to measure its spread. </p><p>Guillaume Duflos, research director at French food safety agency ANSES, said the team sought to “investigate the quantity of microplastics in different types of drinks sold in France and examine the impact different containers can have.” </p><p>The researchers found an average of around 100 microplastic particles per liter in glass bottles of soft drinks, lemonade, iced tea and beer. That was five to 50 times higher than the rate detected in plastic bottles or metal cans. </p><p>“We expected the opposite result,” Ph.D. student Iseline Chaib, who conducted the research, told us. “We then noticed that from the glass, the particles emerging in the samples were the same shape, color and polymer composition — so therefore the same plastic — as the paint on the outside of the caps that seal the glass bottles,” she said. </p><p>The paint on the caps also had “tiny scratches, invisible to the naked eye, probably due to friction between the caps when there were stored,” the agency said in a statement. </p><p>This could then “release particles onto the surface of the caps,” it added. </p><h2 id="Wine-fine"><a href="#Wine-fine" class="headerlink" title="Wine fine"></a>Wine fine</h2><p>For water, both flat and sparkling, the amount of microplastic was relatively low in all cases, ranging from 4.5 particles per liter in glass bottles to 1.6 particles in plastic. </p><p>Wine also contained few microplastics — even glass bottles with caps. Duflos said the reason for this discrepancy “remains to be explained.” </p><p>Soft drinks however contained around 30 microplastics per liter, lemonade 40 and beer around 60. </p><p>Because there is no reference level for a potentially toxic amount of microplastics, it was not possible to say whether these figures represent a health risk, ANSES said. </p><p>But drink manufacturers could easily reduce the amount of microplastics shed by bottle caps, it added. </p><p>The agency tested a cleaning method involving blowing the caps with air, then rinsing them with water and alcohol, which reduced contamination by 60%. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For many, coffee is considered an essential part of daily life. </p><p>However, some remain concerned about the potential negative health effects of coffee consumption. </p><p>With conflicting information circulating about its risks and benefits, questions persist: Is coffee truly good for you, or could it be doing more harm than good? </p><p>New research warns that the health effects of coffee may depend heavily on how it is consumed.</p><p>In June 2024, researchers from Harbin Medical University published a large - scale study in <em>The Journal of Nutrition</em>, analyzing health data from over 180,000 participants aged 37 to 73 over an 8.8 - year period. </p><p>The study found that individuals who drank more than two cups of unsweetened coffee daily had a 5 percent lower risk of developing cancer and a 25 percent reduction in mortality. </p><p>In contrast, those who consumed more than two cups of sweetened coffee per day experienced a 6 percent increase in cancer risk and a 25 percent rise in overall mortality — with respiratory cancers showing the strongest association.</p><p>To reap the health benefits of coffee, researchers recommend sticking to unsweetened versions. </p><p>If black coffee is too bitter, small amounts of milk, oat milk, or soy milk can be added to enhance flavor and smoothness without compromising health.</p><p>Research suggests that moderate consumption of 2 - 3 cups of coffee in the morning is associated with a more significant reduction in mortality risk. </p><p>Health experts generally recommend that healthy adults limit their daily caffeine intake to no more than 400 milligrams.</p><p>Drinking coffee after meals can aid digestion while reducing stomach irritation. </p><p>Additionally, it’s best to let coffee cool below 65°C before drinking to avoid esophageal damage from hot liquids. </p><p>Savoring it slowly in small sips not only enhances its energizing effect but also allows you to fully appreciate the coffee’s aroma.</p><p>Caution is also advised when coffee is consumed alongside certain medications. </p><p>Caffeine can counteract the effects of sedatives and sleeping pills such as diazepam or alprazolam. </p><p>When combined with painkillers like ibuprofen or aspirin, it may aggravate gastric irritation, increasing the risk of stomach bleeding. </p><p>It can also interfere with calcium absorption and exacerbate osteoporosis when taken with bone health supplements like calcium carbonate or alendronate.</p><p>Ultimately, coffee is not a cure - all. </p><p>Even when consumed correctly, it cannot make up for unhealthy lifestyle habits. </p><p>True well - being requires consistent sleep, a balanced diet, and regular exercise. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In past eras, the wealthy tended to attire themselves in the richest of colors: indigo, crimson, the purple of nobilities and kings. </p><p>We are no longer in that era. These days, the hue preferred by the richest people on earth is that most bland and mousy of non - colors — beige.</p><p>For Lindsey Woodcock, a luxury travel consultant, the beige onslaught first revealed itself on the terraces and streets of St. Moritz, Switzerland, the exclusive Alpine resort town where she lives part - time.</p><p>“It becomes something you can’t not see, “ said Ms. Woodcock, who also has residences in London and Sun Valley, Idaho. </p><p>“There are flocks of people cruising around entirely in cream or beige or off - white.”</p><p>Why is this? </p><p>The question was put to Alessandro Sartori, the artistic director of Ermenegildo Zegna, the Italian luxury goods label known for outfitting corporate titans and tech moguls. </p><p>“The ultrawealthy don’t want to show off, and beige colors are good in that sense,” Mr. Sartori said by phone from Milan. </p><p>“This class of people is super discreet and doesn’t want to be seen.”</p><p>To be fashionably superrich, he suggested, is to be clad in the anodyne colors of baby food, tea cookies or screen savers: latte, oatmeal, cream, butterscotch, café au lait.</p><p>“It is all within a limited tonality — stylish, but not too much out of the perimeter of being noticeable,” Mr. Sartori said.</p><p>For André de Farias, a Brazilian entrepreneur who spends winter at the Swiss resort town, the reassuring tones — restful, luxe, uncontroversial — are consistent with the overall tastes of the ultrarich. </p><p>“It’s a crowd that values quality over quantity, and authenticity over showiness,” Mr. de Farias said by email.</p><p>“It’s a mature kind of luxury that doesn’t seek external validation.”</p><p>If bold hues once were a tell for wealth, now a preference for quiet colors has evolved into a “statement of luxury and power,” according to Filippo Ricci, the creative director of Stefano Ricci, a superluxury men’s wear purveyor in Florence, Italy.</p><p>“If you want a chair in crocodile that is like a throne, we can provide it,” Mr. Ricci said. </p><p>Yet, even among the crocodile - throne set, he has noticed a shift. </p><p>“My feeling is that color will eventually come back,” he said. </p><p>“But right now, everybody likes beige.”</p><p>Certain members of the rarefied classes have adopted the related fashion strategy of dressing down. </p><p>In particular, two social fixtures of St. Moritz — Rolf Sachs, an heir to several industrial fortunes and the proprietor of the exclusive Dracula Club, and his longtime companion, the German fashion designer and princess Mafalda of Hesse — favor what might be termed the zillionaire ragamuffin look.</p><p>Whether it includes the off - the - rack parkas and old jeans that the couple favor on the slopes, or the pale sable capes some wear while ordering truffle pizza on the deck of Langosteria restaurant, the muted style now in favor among the wealthy stands in stark contrast to historical preference.</p><p>During the Spanish colonial era, for instance, a carmine hue devised by the Aztec and Mayan people (and derived from an insect that feeds on prickly pear cactus) became a global commodity, as hotly traded as silver.</p><p>The shift away from lush color as status marker is fairly recent, according to Caroline Rennolds Milbank, a fashion historian. </p><p>“In the early 20th and 19th centuries, very rich people wouldn’t have wanted to wear something that was that practical,” Ms. Milbank said. </p><p>“Beige was associated with work wear and the most pedestrian of utilitarian clothes.”</p><p>In keeping with the shift away from bright hues among the wealthy, the Pantone Color Institute has named “mocha mousse” its 2025 Color of the Year. </p><p>In selecting this shade, the Pantone committee was inspired by the feelings it evoked of “comfort, indulgence and subtle elegance,” said Leatrice Eiseman, the institute’s executive director. </p><p>“When we do color&#x2F;word association, the creams, the taupes, the camels signify that something has longevity, lineage, is long lasting and secure,” she added. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2023, people around the world took an estimated 5.3 billion photos, about 61,400 every second, according to photography data site Phototorial. </p><p>“People record much more data about their lives than any previous generation,” says Fabian Hutmacher, a psychologist at the University of Würzburg who studies how digital media shapes our memories. </p><p>“It’s natural to ask: does that change anything about the way we remember our lives?”</p><h1 id="How-digital-photos-are-reshaping-our-memory"><a href="#How-digital-photos-are-reshaping-our-memory" class="headerlink" title="How digital photos are reshaping our memory"></a>How digital photos are reshaping our memory</h1><p>Autobiographical memory — our recollection of personal life events — is central to how we understand ourselves. </p><p>“Memories are crucial for defining who we are,” says Hutmacher. </p><p>“They’re a sort of reservoir that we refer to whenever we think about our lives.”</p><p>Memory, however, isn’t like playing back a video. </p><p>Neuroscientific research shows that this type of memory depends on interactions between the hippocampus, which helps consolidate new experiences, and the prefrontal cortex, which organizes them into coherent life narratives. </p><p>These systems are especially sensitive to attention and emotional engagement — factors that may be disrupted when we’re more focused on photographing a moment than experiencing it.</p><p>“Our memory is not faithful,” says Julia Soares, assistant professor of psychology at Mississippi State University. </p><p>“It’s tied up with who you are and your story making throughout your life. </p><p>It’s your autobiography.”</p><p>Photos can support this reconstructive storytelling. </p><p>Researchers agree that images often help jog memory by surfacing details or emotions we might otherwise forget. </p><p>“I take them partly to document, but also as a way of holding onto moments I know I’ll want to revisit,” says 20 - year - old Alina Nguyen. </p><p>“It’s like a time capsule — sometimes I remember specific feelings or details I’d completely forgotten until I see an image…</p><p>I think I’ve learned a lot about myself just by noticing patterns or changes in the photos over time.”</p><p>For Hutmacher, though, photos are more than just a cue for memories. </p><p>He argues that in the digital age, photos are actually changing how we form memories in the first place. </p><p>Remembering, he says, is no longer purely internal; it’s an interaction between our minds and resources like photos, meaning it’s built not only from what we store in our brains but also from what we offload onto devices like smartphones.</p><p>While offloading can reduce cognitive burden, studies suggest it may also weaken our ability to recall details unless we actively review the material later. </p><p>As a result, when we turn to digital files to reconstruct an event, those images don’t just support our memory — they become part of it.</p><p>This shift raises new questions. </p><p>If our memories are partly constructed through what we photograph — and what we choose to revisit — then our devices aren’t just reflecting our past. </p><p>They’re shaping which moments we remember, how vividly, and supposedly how well we interpret our personal histories.</p><h1 id="When-too-many-photos-backfire"><a href="#When-too-many-photos-backfire" class="headerlink" title="When too many photos backfire"></a>When too many photos backfire</h1><p>Still, more pictures don’t necessarily mean stronger memories. </p><p>A 2013 study by cognitive psychologist Linda Henkel found that photographing objects can actually impair memory, with participants appearing to “rely on the external device of the camera to’remember’ for them.” </p><p>However, when participants engaged with the objects they photographed, they remembered them better. </p><p>“If you go to a concert and you spend 90 minutes filming, focusing on getting a good angle, then it reduces your enjoyment of the situation, as well as the memory you have of it,” says Hutmacher. </p><p>“On the other hand, if you record a snapshot because it’s your favourite song, then it can improve memory later.”</p><p>Even so, most people don’t regularly revisit their photos. </p><p>And without reviewing or organizing them, pictures can become overwhelming, making it harder to find the meaningful ones. “It can be a rose with a thorn,” says Soares. </p><p>“Photos provide these incredible memory cues. But if you never review them, you’re not capitalizing on that benefit, and you may actually be losing something from the act of taking the photo.”</p><p>Parenting expert Kirsty Ketley understands that trade - off. With thousands of images stored on her phone — and backed up to the cloud — she began to feel burdened by her digital archive. </p><p>“It does become very overwhelming,” she says. When she was alerted that her storage was running out, she decided to take fewer photographs, focusing on special occasions and events. </p><p>“Parents just [take photos] without thinking,” she says. “I feel I can enjoy the time more because I’m not so worried about whether I’ve got the positioning right. </p><p>I’m there in the moment…It does help to keep those memories alive.” </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a typical Monday morning. </p><p>You wake up, reach for your phone, and within seconds, you’re scrolling through an endless stream of updates.  </p><p>Your college roommate has a new puppy.  </p><p>Your aunt’s dog just died.  </p><p>Your coworker made homemade sourdough bread.  </p><p>Your second cousin just broke up with their partner.  </p><p>Very, very publicly.  </p><p>And before long, you’re adding to the noise.  </p><p>You’re posting about your early morning fog, your seasonal depression, that crushing existential dread.  </p><p>Etc.  </p><p>Without realizing it, you’ve consumed and shared more personal information with the people in your life before your first cup of coffee than your grandparents did in a month.  </p><p>It’s all painfully, intensely human.  </p><p>That’s not always a good thing.  </p><p>This constant input and output of information, this ceaseless sharing of our lives, has become so normalized that we barely notice it anymore.  </p><p>It seems like innocuous behavior.  </p><p>But there are psychological, social, and emotional consequences that we’re only beginning to understand.  </p><p>From the earliest cave paintings to our ancestors’ oral storytelling traditions, we’ve always found ways to communicate our experiences to others.  </p><p>Social media has amplified this urge to unprecedented levels.  </p><p>With just a few taps on a screen, we can instantly share our thoughts, feelings, and experiences with hundreds or even thousands of people.  </p><p>It’s a power that would have seemed almost godlike just a few decades ago.  </p><p>As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.  </p><p>And just to rip the band-aid right off — it’s a responsibility that many of us are ill-equipped to handle.  </p><p>We tear ourselves apart, we spiral — and then spiral over our spiraling.  </p><p>We don’t know how or when to stop.  </p><p>In the pre-digital age, privacy was the default state.  </p><p>Sharing information required effort — writing a letter, making a phone call, or having a face-to-face conversation.  </p><p>Now, privacy requires effort.  </p><p>We have to actively choose not to share, to resist the temptation to post, to keep our thoughts and experiences to ourselves.  </p><p>This reversal has profound implications.  </p><p>When sharing is the default, we share without thinking, flooding our networks with a constant stream of information.  </p><p>Some of it’s harmless, sure.  </p><p>So much of it is deeply personal, our darkest moments, our fears, our compulsive thoughts.  </p><p>Relationships are strained or ended because of misinterpreted tweets.  </p><p>Reputations are damaged by ill-considered updates.  </p><p>These are not hypothetical scenarios — they’re the reality for a lot of folks who have fallen victim to their own oversharing.  </p><p>And the risks aren’t just external.  </p><p>When we’re always performing for an audience, always curating our experiences for public consumption, we’re losing touch with ourselves.  </p><p>Think about the last time you had a meaningful experience.  </p><p>Even just a moment you want to remember.  </p><p>Did you immediately reach for your phone to share it?  </p><p>And, in that moment of sharing, did you fully experience the event itself?  </p><p>Or were you already thinking about how to frame it for your followers?  </p><p>This constant curation of our lives for public consumption creates a dangerous feedback loop.  </p><p>We don’t value experiences for their intrinsic worth — we value them solely for their shareability.  </p><p>We judge our lives by how they look to others, not by how they feel to us.  </p><p>The answer to all of this is simpler than you think: start a journal.  </p><p>Groundbreaking, I know.  </p><p>Journaling is nothing new, of course.  </p><p>People have been keeping diaries and journals for centuries.  </p><p>In the oversharing era, the humble journal takes on new significance.  </p><p>Journaling itself becomes a radical act of privacy, a deliberate choice to keep our thoughts and experiences to ourselves.  </p><p>I think of my journal as my private social media feed, one where I’m the only follower.  </p><p>Like a social media platform, it’s a place for me to share my thoughts, feelings, and experiences.  </p><p>Unlike social media, there’s no pressure for me to perform, no need to curate, no risk of oversharing.  </p><p>Journaling provides a different kind of satisfaction.  </p><p>There’s no immediate feedback, no external validation.  </p><p>Instead, the reward comes from the act of writing itself, from the clarity and insight we gain through self-reflection.  </p><p>It’s a slower, more subtle form of gratification.  </p><p>And that matters.  </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s something about the space environment that changes the flavor of miso in interesting and subtle ways.</p><p>An experiment to create the fermented soybean paste simultaneously here on Earth and aboard the International Space Station found that the space miso tasted intriguingly nuttier and more roasted than miso produced at the same time in the US and Denmark.</p><p>“Fermentation [on the ISS] illustrates how a living system at the microbial scale can thrive through the diversity of its microbial community, emphasizing the potential for life to exist in space,” says industrial design scientist Maggie Coblentz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>“While the ISS is often seen as a sterile environment, our research shows that microbes and non-human life have agency in space, raising significant bioethical questions about removing plants and microbes from their home planet and introducing them to extraterrestrial environments.”</p><p>Miso is a tasty, salty fermented paste used extensively in Japanese cuisine.</p><p>It’s made from steamed soybeans, salt, grains such as rice or barley, and kōjī (Aspergillus oryzae), the fungus behind the miso fermentation process.</p><p>The team’s experimental setup was pretty simple.</p><p>The researchers prepared three batches of miso starter, then sent these batches to the three different locations: Cambridge, Massachusetts; Copenhagen; and low-Earth orbit aboard the International Space Station.</p><p>In the higher-radiation and microgravity environment of the ISS, the experimental batch fermented for 30 days, housed inside a specially designed sensing box that monitored temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and radiation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Cambridge batch was housed in an identical box, but the Copenhagen batch was not.</p><p>This allowed the Copenhagen batch to serve as a control to gauge whether the sensing box itself altered the fermentation process.</p><p>Once the 30-day fermentation process was complete, the miso was shuttled back home to Earth to be analyzed and compared to the two terrestrial control batches.</p><p>That analysis involved genome sequencing to study the microbe populations in the miso pastes, assessment of the physical properties such as texture and color, and an evaluation of the flavor profiles.</p><p>The space miso fermented successfully, but it was noticeably different from the Earth miso pastes.</p><p>The microbial communities in the space miso, for example, contained higher populations of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus warneri, possibly as a result of the warmer temperature on the space station.</p><p>In addition, the bacterium Bacillus velezensis was only identified in the space miso.</p><p>As for the flavor of the three miso pastes, all had similar aroma compounds and amino acids, and the characteristic yummy salty flavor expected.</p><p>However, the space miso was nuttier and more roasted in taste, the researchers found.</p><p>This flavor is associated with pyrazine compounds that probably emerged as a result of the higher ISS temperatures too, which would have accelerated the fermentation process.</p><p>It’s a fascinating result that demonstrates the differences environmental tweaks can make on how life organizes itself, and how we might eat as we explore the stars – especially since our sense of taste is dulled in microgravity.</p><p>“By bringing together microbiology, flavor chemistry, sensory science, and larger social and cultural considerations, our study opens up new directions to explore how life changes when it travels to new environments like space,” says food scientist Joshua Evans of the Technical University of Denmark.</p><p>“It could enhance astronaut well-being and performance, especially on future long-term space missions.</p><p>More broadly, it could invite new forms of culinary expression, expanding and diversifying culinary and cultural representation in space exploration as the field grows.”</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We live in a culture obsessed with success.<br>From our earliest years, society hands us a map for success — prestigious schools, lucrative careers, impressive titles, material acquisitions — without being taught how to read our own internal compass.</p><p>What does this mean for you?<br>It means it’s harder than ever to determine what your version of success actually looks like.<br>The measures we’ve been told matter — explicitly or unconsciously — are largely misaligned with genuine fulfilment.<br>There’s too much noise drowning out your internal signals.</p><h1 id="The-true-cost-of-misalignment"><a href="#The-true-cost-of-misalignment" class="headerlink" title="The true cost of misalignment"></a>The true cost of misalignment</h1><p>When you allow external interference to redirect your compass, two losses occur.</p><p>First, you shape-shift to fit into a box of someone else’s design.<br>You cram yourself into a shape because of what you imagine others want from you.<br>I watched myself become increasingly concerned with fitting in rather than asking, “What do I actually want here?”</p><p>Second, you gradually lose the ability to hear your own internal signals.<br>Like a muscle that atrophies from disuse, your capacity to discern what genuinely matters to you weakens over time.<br>The noise drowns out the signal until you no longer remember what your own true north feels like.</p><p>The combined cost is a life lived inauthentically — a draining, inefficient, and ultimately unsatisfying way to move through the world.<br>It’s death by a thousand paper cuts, where each decision unaligned with your values takes another small slice of your vital energy.</p><p>Don’t do that.<br>Contrast this with compass-aligned living — the state where your actions and choices follow your internal direction rather than external maps.<br>This creates a positive feedback loop, an eternal engine generating its own momentum.</p><p>You already know what you truly want and need.<br>It’s carried within you — in your unique disposition, your natural inclinations, the things that genuinely light you up when no one’s watching or measuring, the presence you bring to every room you walk into.</p><p>You just need to listen closely enough to hear it.<br>You need to quiet the external noise to discern it.<br>You need to do the inner work of separating what’s authentically yours from what you’ve been told to want.</p><p>It’s never too late to begin this work.<br>It’s never too early to start.<br>And it’s always worthwhile to revisit and refine as you grow.</p><h1 id="Calibrating-your-compass-Finding-true-north"><a href="#Calibrating-your-compass-Finding-true-north" class="headerlink" title="Calibrating your compass: Finding true north"></a>Calibrating your compass: Finding true north</h1><p>So, we’ve identified the interference and recognized its cost.<br>Now comes the essential question: How do you work with your compass to find your true north?</p><p>In its simplest form, this means identifying what you truly value — not what you’ve been told to value, not what looks good to others, but what matters deeply and authentically to you.<br>It means taking the things you believe to be sacred and being willing to sacrifice for their pursuit, protection, and power.</p><p>If you’re not willing to give anything up for something, it isn’t truly a value — it’s a preference.<br>And if you can’t explain why you value this thing, that value isn’t yours, it’s somebody else’s.</p><p>Once identified, these compass directions simplify decision-making tremendously.<br>When faced with choices, I ask whether an option will facilitate growth and whether it aligns with integrity.<br>If both answers are yes, my path is clear.<br>If either is no, I know I’m being pulled off course.</p><p>This clarity doesn’t mean the path is always easy.<br>Following your own compass often means departing from well-worn trails and familiar landmarks.<br>It means disappointing people who expected you to follow their maps, and being ok with their negative feelings about it.<br>It means embracing uncertainty.</p><p>But the alternative — continuing to follow directions to someone else’s destination — guarantees arrival at a place that wasn’t meant for you.<br>Regular recalibration is essential.<br>Notice where you’ve made choices based on external expectations rather than internal alignment.<br>Be gentle with yourself when you discover you’ve gone off course — the goal isn’t perfect navigation but gradual improvement in reading your own signals.</p><p>This process isn’t about rejecting all external input.<br>Other people’s maps can provide useful information about terrain and potential paths.<br>The key difference is that YOU decide which direction to take, based on your own internal compass rather than external pressure.</p><p>Your compass has always been within you.<br>Now it’s time to learn to read it.<br>The poet Mary Oliver perhaps captured it best when she asked: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?”</p><p>The answer won’t be found on anyone else’s map.<br>It can only be discovered by following your own compass.</p><p>Origin URL：<a href="https://web.shanbay-lifelongedu-a2.com/reading/news/hbzbu/share?channel=shanbay">Link</a> </p>]]></content>
