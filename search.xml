        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a typical Monday morning. </p><p>You wake up, reach for your phone, and within seconds, you’re scrolling through an endless stream of updates.  </p><p>Your college roommate has a new puppy.  </p><p>Your aunt’s dog just died.  </p><p>Your coworker made homemade sourdough bread.  </p><p>Your second cousin just broke up with their partner.  </p><p>Very, very publicly.  </p><p>And before long, you’re adding to the noise.  </p><p>You’re posting about your early morning fog, your seasonal depression, that crushing existential dread.  </p><p>Etc.  </p><p>Without realizing it, you’ve consumed and shared more personal information with the people in your life before your first cup of coffee than your grandparents did in a month.  </p><p>It’s all painfully, intensely human.  </p><p>That’s not always a good thing.  </p><p>This constant input and output of information, this ceaseless sharing of our lives, has become so normalized that we barely notice it anymore.  </p><p>It seems like innocuous behavior.  </p><p>But there are psychological, social, and emotional consequences that we’re only beginning to understand.  </p><p>From the earliest cave paintings to our ancestors’ oral storytelling traditions, we’ve always found ways to communicate our experiences to others.  </p><p>Social media has amplified this urge to unprecedented levels.  </p><p>With just a few taps on a screen, we can instantly share our thoughts, feelings, and experiences with hundreds or even thousands of people.  </p><p>It’s a power that would have seemed almost godlike just a few decades ago.  </p><p>As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.  </p><p>And just to rip the band-aid right off — it’s a responsibility that many of us are ill-equipped to handle.  </p><p>We tear ourselves apart, we spiral — and then spiral over our spiraling.  </p><p>We don’t know how or when to stop.  </p><p>In the pre-digital age, privacy was the default state.  </p><p>Sharing information required effort — writing a letter, making a phone call, or having a face-to-face conversation.  </p><p>Now, privacy requires effort.  </p><p>We have to actively choose not to share, to resist the temptation to post, to keep our thoughts and experiences to ourselves.  </p><p>This reversal has profound implications.  </p><p>When sharing is the default, we share without thinking, flooding our networks with a constant stream of information.  </p><p>Some of it’s harmless, sure.  </p><p>So much of it is deeply personal, our darkest moments, our fears, our compulsive thoughts.  </p><p>Relationships are strained or ended because of misinterpreted tweets.  </p><p>Reputations are damaged by ill-considered updates.  </p><p>These are not hypothetical scenarios — they’re the reality for a lot of folks who have fallen victim to their own oversharing.  </p><p>And the risks aren’t just external.  </p><p>When we’re always performing for an audience, always curating our experiences for public consumption, we’re losing touch with ourselves.  </p><p>Think about the last time you had a meaningful experience.  </p><p>Even just a moment you want to remember.  </p><p>Did you immediately reach for your phone to share it?  </p><p>And, in that moment of sharing, did you fully experience the event itself?  </p><p>Or were you already thinking about how to frame it for your followers?  </p><p>This constant curation of our lives for public consumption creates a dangerous feedback loop.  </p><p>We don’t value experiences for their intrinsic worth — we value them solely for their shareability.  </p><p>We judge our lives by how they look to others, not by how they feel to us.  </p><p>The answer to all of this is simpler than you think: start a journal.  </p><p>Groundbreaking, I know.  </p><p>Journaling is nothing new, of course.  </p><p>People have been keeping diaries and journals for centuries.  </p><p>In the oversharing era, the humble journal takes on new significance.  </p><p>Journaling itself becomes a radical act of privacy, a deliberate choice to keep our thoughts and experiences to ourselves.  </p><p>I think of my journal as my private social media feed, one where I’m the only follower.  </p><p>Like a social media platform, it’s a place for me to share my thoughts, feelings, and experiences.  </p><p>Unlike social media, there’s no pressure for me to perform, no need to curate, no risk of oversharing.  </p><p>Journaling provides a different kind of satisfaction.  </p><p>There’s no immediate feedback, no external validation.  </p><p>Instead, the reward comes from the act of writing itself, from the clarity and insight we gain through self-reflection.  </p><p>It’s a slower, more subtle form of gratification.  </p><p>And that matters.  </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s something about the space environment that changes the flavor of miso in interesting and subtle ways.</p><p>An experiment to create the fermented soybean paste simultaneously here on Earth and aboard the International Space Station found that the space miso tasted intriguingly nuttier and more roasted than miso produced at the same time in the US and Denmark.</p><p>“Fermentation [on the ISS] illustrates how a living system at the microbial scale can thrive through the diversity of its microbial community, emphasizing the potential for life to exist in space,” says industrial design scientist Maggie Coblentz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>“While the ISS is often seen as a sterile environment, our research shows that microbes and non-human life have agency in space, raising significant bioethical questions about removing plants and microbes from their home planet and introducing them to extraterrestrial environments.”</p><p>Miso is a tasty, salty fermented paste used extensively in Japanese cuisine.</p><p>It’s made from steamed soybeans, salt, grains such as rice or barley, and kōjī (Aspergillus oryzae), the fungus behind the miso fermentation process.</p><p>The team’s experimental setup was pretty simple.</p><p>The researchers prepared three batches of miso starter, then sent these batches to the three different locations: Cambridge, Massachusetts; Copenhagen; and low-Earth orbit aboard the International Space Station.</p><p>In the higher-radiation and microgravity environment of the ISS, the experimental batch fermented for 30 days, housed inside a specially designed sensing box that monitored temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and radiation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Cambridge batch was housed in an identical box, but the Copenhagen batch was not.</p><p>This allowed the Copenhagen batch to serve as a control to gauge whether the sensing box itself altered the fermentation process.</p><p>Once the 30-day fermentation process was complete, the miso was shuttled back home to Earth to be analyzed and compared to the two terrestrial control batches.</p><p>That analysis involved genome sequencing to study the microbe populations in the miso pastes, assessment of the physical properties such as texture and color, and an evaluation of the flavor profiles.</p><p>The space miso fermented successfully, but it was noticeably different from the Earth miso pastes.</p><p>The microbial communities in the space miso, for example, contained higher populations of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus warneri, possibly as a result of the warmer temperature on the space station.</p><p>In addition, the bacterium Bacillus velezensis was only identified in the space miso.</p><p>As for the flavor of the three miso pastes, all had similar aroma compounds and amino acids, and the characteristic yummy salty flavor expected.</p><p>However, the space miso was nuttier and more roasted in taste, the researchers found.</p><p>This flavor is associated with pyrazine compounds that probably emerged as a result of the higher ISS temperatures too, which would have accelerated the fermentation process.</p><p>It’s a fascinating result that demonstrates the differences environmental tweaks can make on how life organizes itself, and how we might eat as we explore the stars – especially since our sense of taste is dulled in microgravity.</p><p>“By bringing together microbiology, flavor chemistry, sensory science, and larger social and cultural considerations, our study opens up new directions to explore how life changes when it travels to new environments like space,” says food scientist Joshua Evans of the Technical University of Denmark.</p><p>“It could enhance astronaut well-being and performance, especially on future long-term space missions.</p><p>More broadly, it could invite new forms of culinary expression, expanding and diversifying culinary and cultural representation in space exploration as the field grows.”</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We live in a culture obsessed with success.<br>From our earliest years, society hands us a map for success — prestigious schools, lucrative careers, impressive titles, material acquisitions — without being taught how to read our own internal compass.</p><p>What does this mean for you?<br>It means it’s harder than ever to determine what your version of success actually looks like.<br>The measures we’ve been told matter — explicitly or unconsciously — are largely misaligned with genuine fulfilment.<br>There’s too much noise drowning out your internal signals.</p><h1 id="The-true-cost-of-misalignment"><a href="#The-true-cost-of-misalignment" class="headerlink" title="The true cost of misalignment"></a>The true cost of misalignment</h1><p>When you allow external interference to redirect your compass, two losses occur.</p><p>First, you shape-shift to fit into a box of someone else’s design.<br>You cram yourself into a shape because of what you imagine others want from you.<br>I watched myself become increasingly concerned with fitting in rather than asking, “What do I actually want here?”</p><p>Second, you gradually lose the ability to hear your own internal signals.<br>Like a muscle that atrophies from disuse, your capacity to discern what genuinely matters to you weakens over time.<br>The noise drowns out the signal until you no longer remember what your own true north feels like.</p><p>The combined cost is a life lived inauthentically — a draining, inefficient, and ultimately unsatisfying way to move through the world.<br>It’s death by a thousand paper cuts, where each decision unaligned with your values takes another small slice of your vital energy.</p><p>Don’t do that.<br>Contrast this with compass-aligned living — the state where your actions and choices follow your internal direction rather than external maps.<br>This creates a positive feedback loop, an eternal engine generating its own momentum.</p><p>You already know what you truly want and need.<br>It’s carried within you — in your unique disposition, your natural inclinations, the things that genuinely light you up when no one’s watching or measuring, the presence you bring to every room you walk into.</p><p>You just need to listen closely enough to hear it.<br>You need to quiet the external noise to discern it.<br>You need to do the inner work of separating what’s authentically yours from what you’ve been told to want.</p><p>It’s never too late to begin this work.<br>It’s never too early to start.<br>And it’s always worthwhile to revisit and refine as you grow.</p><h1 id="Calibrating-your-compass-Finding-true-north"><a href="#Calibrating-your-compass-Finding-true-north" class="headerlink" title="Calibrating your compass: Finding true north"></a>Calibrating your compass: Finding true north</h1><p>So, we’ve identified the interference and recognized its cost.<br>Now comes the essential question: How do you work with your compass to find your true north?</p><p>In its simplest form, this means identifying what you truly value — not what you’ve been told to value, not what looks good to others, but what matters deeply and authentically to you.<br>It means taking the things you believe to be sacred and being willing to sacrifice for their pursuit, protection, and power.</p><p>If you’re not willing to give anything up for something, it isn’t truly a value — it’s a preference.<br>And if you can’t explain why you value this thing, that value isn’t yours, it’s somebody else’s.</p><p>Once identified, these compass directions simplify decision-making tremendously.<br>When faced with choices, I ask whether an option will facilitate growth and whether it aligns with integrity.<br>If both answers are yes, my path is clear.<br>If either is no, I know I’m being pulled off course.</p><p>This clarity doesn’t mean the path is always easy.<br>Following your own compass often means departing from well-worn trails and familiar landmarks.<br>It means disappointing people who expected you to follow their maps, and being ok with their negative feelings about it.<br>It means embracing uncertainty.</p><p>But the alternative — continuing to follow directions to someone else’s destination — guarantees arrival at a place that wasn’t meant for you.<br>Regular recalibration is essential.<br>Notice where you’ve made choices based on external expectations rather than internal alignment.<br>Be gentle with yourself when you discover you’ve gone off course — the goal isn’t perfect navigation but gradual improvement in reading your own signals.</p><p>This process isn’t about rejecting all external input.<br>Other people’s maps can provide useful information about terrain and potential paths.<br>The key difference is that YOU decide which direction to take, based on your own internal compass rather than external pressure.</p><p>Your compass has always been within you.<br>Now it’s time to learn to read it.<br>The poet Mary Oliver perhaps captured it best when she asked: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?”</p><p>The answer won’t be found on anyone else’s map.<br>It can only be discovered by following your own compass.</p><p>Origin URL：<a href="https://web.shanbay-lifelongedu-a2.com/reading/news/hbzbu/share?channel=shanbay">Link</a> </p>]]></content>
