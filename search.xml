        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Original Title: Dining Alone is So Difficult</strong></p><p>There are few customers Conor Proft appreciates more than people who eat alone.</p><p>A bartender at the Italian restaurant Fausto, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, he said the solo diners he serves tend to be more engaged and willing to chat.</p><p>They are self-aware and more attuned to the restaurant’s rhythms.</p><p>But does Mr. Proft dine alone? Rarely.</p><p>“I love the romantic ideal of going into a restaurant and sitting at the bar and striking up a conversation with a bartender,” he said.</p><p>“But oftentimes in practice, I am just consumed with anxiety” about standing out.</p><p>This is part of the paradox of solo dining.</p><p>Even as Americans are spending more time on their own, many find eating out alone to be rife with awkwardness and judgment.</p><p>And many restaurateurs, who already run their businesses on thin profit margins, worry that tables for one will cost them.</p><p>Reservations for solo dining in the United States have risen by 64 percent since 2019, according to data from OpenTable, and 21 percent from 2022 to 2023, according to Resy.</p><p>The trend may stem in part from a post-pandemic uptick in business trips, when solo travelers need to grab a bite, or the rising attention given to self-care, said Debby Soo, OpenTable’s chief executive.</p><p>But more solo dining doesn’t necessarily mean better accommodation or less of a stigma, according to diners and restaurateurs interviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>Several diners described the experience of entering a restaurant hoping to treat themselves to a relaxing meal, then feeling guilty for taking up space, or fearful that they’re being judged by everyone around them.</p><p>“When you walk in by yourself, the look on the host or hostess’s face changes,” said Rajika Shah, a lawyer in Los Angeles who used to dine alone frequently, as she moved often for work and wanted to explore local dining.</p><p>“It is sometimes a look of panic, like ‘What are we going to do with this person?’ Or sometimes it is a look of sympathy.”</p><p>Ms. Shah, 51, said she is often led to the worst table in the dining room, neglected by her server, and then rushed out at the end of the meal.</p><p>She blamed the tipping system — because workers are reliant on tips, she said, they may be less attentive to those who spend less than groups.</p><p>“I am just so tired of being treated like a second-class citizen,” she said.</p><p>Even the menu can feel exclusionary.</p><p>The shareable small plates that dominate many menus make it expensive and “difficult to eat a balanced and well-proportioned meal alone,” said Amanda Lao, 55, who lives in Chicago and started solo dining while traveling for her former job as an auditor.</p><p>The assumption that people need to be coupled or grouped goes beyond restaurants, said Bella DePaulo, a social psychologist in Summerland, Calif., and the author of the 2023 book “Single at Heart: The Power, Freedom and Heart-Filling Joy of Single Life.”</p><p>Scientists have long examined the negative impacts of solitude, but studies on how it can be a peaceful, self-esteem-building experience are rarer, she said.</p><p>The 2025 World Happiness Report, published last week by the University of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research Centre, suggests that solitary activities, including solo meals, can lead to depression and shorter life expectancies.</p><p>Dr. DePaulo also pointed to a recent, highly circulated article in The Atlantic, “The Anti-Social Century,” which links practices like solo dining to reclusion and loneliness.</p><p>Dr. DePaulo finds that conclusion dubious.</p><p>“People who are lonely are going to stay home,” she said. “They are not going to go out to a restaurant. People who go out on their own are confident.”</p><p>To her, this bias against lone diners feels distinctly American.</p><p>Since the 1950s, she said, the United States has placed a high value on the nuclear family.</p><p>“We are a nation that really romanticizes romantic coupling and marriage, and stigmatizing people who are single or do things alone is part of that,” she said.</p><p>She compared this with attitudes in countries like Japan, where it is common to see someone slurping ramen or enjoying an omakase solo.</p><p>At a time when 46.4 percent of American adults are single, according to 2022 census data, and many couples are sleeping or even living separately, Dr. DePaulo said, why shouldn’t it be socially acceptable to dine alone?</p><p>Several people interviewed said they felt more comfortable eating alone at a casual restaurant than at a high-end one.</p><p>Others said it felt easier in big cities, which allow you to be more anonymous when you walk into a restaurant.</p><p>Identity markers like race and gender also play a role.</p><p>Aaron Fountain, 33, an editor at the National Museum of African American History and Culture who lives in Silver Spring, Md., said he often gets poor treatment when he dines alone, whether it’s being asked to pay in advance at a sit-down restaurant or being ignored by bartenders.</p><p>He wondered if this is because he is Black, not because he is by himself.</p><p>Paula Shepard, a fashion executive in Manhattan, said that as a woman eating alone, she has drawn unwanted attention from men, and some have mistaken her for an escort.</p><p>But she is undeterred.</p><p>She knows that others may see her seated by herself and make assumptions.</p><p>“But I can’t allow others to define who I am,” she said. “I dined alone on Valentine’s Day, for God’s sake.”</p>]]></content>
